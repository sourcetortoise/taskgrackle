Keep your life on track with TaskGrackle, a self-hosted and hackable task management system. Run it on macOS, Windows, or a dedicated [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) terminal in your living/working space.

## Features

- **Task reminders** – see what's most important today
- **Easy check-in** – log self-care, cleaning, work, pet care & more with simple keystrokes
- **Mood checkup** – get tailored self-care tips for your day
- **Morning/evening routines** – highlight tasks that get your day started and relax before bed
- **Exercise break** – a curated list of exercises you can do at home
- **Friends & Family** – reminders to check in with people and communities
- **Work Hour** – a checklist to prepare for a focused work session
- **Grocery list** – don't forget any essentials before going to the store
- **Moon status** – get moon info late at night
- **Customizable** – edit the data files and code to make it your own. Change the `frequency_hours` of each task in `data/tasks.rb` to prioritize what's important.
- **Vice management** – limit counterproductive habits with Gracklecoin rewards
- **Grackle vocalizations** – ignore TaskGrackle for too long and it'll start grackling at you (extremely optional)

Install dependencies: `gem install colorize httparty`

Add to ~/.bashrc:

#### Grackle noises on Raspberry Pi

Some users might appreciate a *graaak* from the bird if it's been too long since a check-in. To use this feature:

Set the number of hours after which your grackle becomes vocal in `data/hours_til.grackle`.

Obtain [grackle sounds](https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/common-grackle) and place in the `sound` directory.

Install VLC & dependencies: `sudo apt-get install vlc pulseaudio alsa-base`

Add a cronjob `crontab -e`:
```
### If it's been long enough, play a grackle sound
## every hour from 9am to 5pm
0 9-17 *   *   *   XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u) /home/pi/taskgrackle/vocalization.sh
```

To connect a USB speaker: locate device in `aplay -l`. Specify card number of device in `/usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf`:
```
defaults.ctl.card #
defaults.pcm.card #
```
Adjust volume with `alsamixer`.
